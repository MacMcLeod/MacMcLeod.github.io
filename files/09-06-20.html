I've been thinking about starting a blog, so this post and the next few are a sort of trial run. Admittedly, I am a boring person living a boring life and I havne't thought about anything in particular I have to share. 
However, if the blogging does work out, then maybe someone will want to know my cat. She was adopted from a rescue a few months ago at six and a half years old. She was shy and skittish for the first few months and, 
to be honest, that probably hasn't changed. While I'm working from home, though, she provides excellent company.
