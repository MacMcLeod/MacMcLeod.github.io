<h1>Fourier Analysis Using MATLAB</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Fourier analysis is used to to mathematically switch a signal back and forth between the frequency and time domains. MATLAB is a common method of implementing fast Fourier transforms (FFT), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), as a means of sampling and discretizing a continuous signal. This reveals the frequency components of a signal observed in the time domain. For example, this can be used to identify a singular frequency to filter out. As the operation is reverible, the inverse (IFFT) can also be performed. FFTs have smaller computational cost than other direct implementations. It is important to note that in the frequency domain, signals have x-axis symmetry, and often it is useful to only observe positive frequencies.</p>
<p>Some applications of this include audo equalization, image processing, and spectroscopy. FFTs can be used to shift a signal to baseband or center frequency. They can be used to filter out noise, if the received signal strength (RSSI) is above the nosie floor. FFTs are used in convolution and IFFTs are used in auto-correlation. These operations are shift-invariant and linear.</p>

<h4>The Convolution Theorem</h4>
<p>Convolution of two time-domain signals is represented as the product of their Fourier transforms. Generally, a signal is convolved with some known response function and the resultant signal appears as the original signal shaped by the response function. Convolution can also be performed with the samples of two discrete functions. It is common in DSP to picture convolution as a sliding window; the response function 'slides' across the input signal, and each point is multiplied. This hints at why zero-padding is important for an accurate response.</p>
<h4>The Correlation Theorem</h4>
<p>Auto-correlation can be performed by multiplying one Fourier transform by the conjugate of the other.</p>


<h3>Discrete Fourier Transform</h3>
<h4>Gibb's Phenomenon</h4>
<p>If you've ever observed a square wave on your school lab's oscilloscope, you're probably familiar with the Gibb's phenomenon. What exactly is going on? Well, an ideal square wave has a number of jump discontinuities as it switches between high and low values. This is represented in the frequency  domain as the sum of all odd harmonics. However it is not practical to represent an infinite series. Truncating the series results in overshoots and undershoots, referred to as the Gibb's Phenomenon. Below is a MATLAB tutorial to illustrate this.</p>

<p>Sigma approximation can be used to reduce to effect of the Gibb's phenomenon.</p>

<h4>Pinsky Phenomenon</h4>
<p>I'll finish this at some point...</p>
