<h4>Presented April 2019 at the <a href="https://www.asnt.org/MajorSiteSections/Events/Past_Events/Research_2019.aspx">ASNT Spring Symposium</a> in </h4>

<p><b>Abstract: </b> Microwave and millimeter wave three-dimensional (3D) imaging has shown potential and utility for a variety of inspecting needs, such as for infrastructure and aerospace applications. Multilayered composites made of dielectric (non-conductive) materials, in particular, are prevalent in many industries and are often backed by conductive substrates made of metals or carbon composites. Millimeter waves, with frequencies in the range of 30 – 300 GHz, in particular are well-suited for nondestructive inspection of non-conductive composites where the relatively short wavelength allows high resolution 3D imaging while providing for signal penetration inside multilayered structures. However, the effect of a conductive-backing substrate on the 3D image, especially for targets near the substrate, has not been comprehensively studied. Multiple reflections and multiple signal paths encountered by the signal as it travels from the interrogating antenna to a targeted flaw, in the presence of strongly reflecting backing material, can make the 3D images highly susceptible to aliasing and distortion. Multiple targets can easily be mistaken for a singular, merged target indication, especially when they are in proximity to the strongly reflecting substrate. However, by properly accounting for the standoff distance of the antenna to the multilayered structure, the scan dimensions (i.e., size of synthetic aperture), and the distance from the target to the substrate, distortions in the target indications can be reduced and more accurate 3D SAR images can be formed. This presentation introduces a study using simulated and measurement results of the effect of the reflecting substrate on the formed images and techniques to reduce geometry dependent aliasing. This study is performed on multiple samples with a wide variety of target sizes, target proximity (laterally and vertically) to each other, and the polarization dependency of targets scattering (i.e., target shape).  </p>

<h4>Presented November 2018 at the <a href="https://www.telemetry.org/">International Telemetering Conference</a> in Glendale, AZ</h4>
<h4>This paper won 2nd place undergraduate paper</a></h4>
<p>As the number of CubeSat launches continues to increase, so will spectral congestion. This presentation focused on the work that went into developed an efficient communication protocol scheme: GMSK modulation, adapatable data rate, efficient data framing, and significant error checking were all developed. The process to layer these protocols was discussed. Then, groundstation networking opportunities with other universties were discussed.</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b> Several iterations of communication systems at the Missouri S&T Satellite Research Team reveal that custom software defined radios (SDR) are viable for low cost, fully functional, and reliable communication systems. Recent licensing policy changes have impacted a number of CubeSat missions, prompting the necessity of responsible spectrum management. In searching for solution to minimize spectral congestion, these systems need to implement responsible data handling through efficient coding and modulation. The flexibility that SDRs provide allows for dynamic link control in orbit. Once completed, the C++ code used to implement this system will be open sourced for future missions’ use. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Communication Systems in CubeSat Missions</h3>
<div class="box shadow">
<h4>Presented May 2018 at the <a href="http://web.mst.edu/~spaceg/">Missouri-NASA Space Grant Consortium</a> in Rolla, MO</h4>
<p>During my sophomore year at S\&T, I was the RF Communications lead for the Nanosat-8 satellite, being built by the Missouri S\&T Satellite Research Team (<a href="http://web.mst.edu/~mrsat/">M-SAT</a>). Throughout the year we built up our space communications link: selecting a radio, building a ground station, writing the code, and primarily troubleshooting our efforts. By using the experience NASA had garnered in developing their Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS), we were able to design our code in a similar fashion and avoid potential pitfalls. A number of CubeSats have been launched and determined "dead on arrival" as there is never any communication. Through extensive testing, this can be prevented.</p>
<p><b>Abstract: </b> Communication is vital to satellite operations, as it delivers mission data, telecommands, and telemetry. Cost, functionality, and development time are three metrics that need to be optimized during design and implementation. In searching for solution to minimize spectral congestion, these systems also need to implement responsible data handling through efficient coding and modulation. Several iterations of communication systems at the Missouri S&T Satellite Research Team reveal that custom software defined radio (SDR) solutions are viable for low cost, fully functional, and reliable communication systems. </p>
