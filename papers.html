<h3>Software Defined Radio Methodologies for CubeSat Reliability</h3>
<p>Work in progress. This is expected to conclude in April 2018.</p>

<h3>Communication Systems in CubeSat Missions</h3>
<!--<p><b>Abstract: </b> Communication is vital to satellite operations, as it delivers mission data, telecommands, and telemetry. Cost, functionality, and development time are three metrics that need to be optimized during design and implementation. In searching for solution to minimize spectral congestion, these systems also need to implement responsible data handling through efficient coding and modulation. Several iterations of communication systems at the Missouri S&T Satellite Research Team reveal that custom software defined radio (SDR) solutions are viable for low cost, fully functional, and reliable communication systems. </p>-->

<h3>Kalman Filters as an Alternative to PLLs</h3>
